# jStateExplorer

This is the jStateExplorer repository. jStateExplorer is a library implementing various breadth first search strategies which can be used to verify program states. jStateExplorer is based on jConstraints and is used in the jpf-psyco tool.

### License

The project is published under the Apache 2.0 License. It is a developement evolved from the code base
contributed originally as search component to PSYCO: https://github.com/psycopaths/psyco/tree/master/src/main/gov/nasa/jpf/psyco/search

The jStateExplorer project isolates the symoblic search into its own component so that we can reuse it in other projects.
